Will they have the capacity to assume control over all the human employments?
                    The initial two inquiries expect that one day a bot will be lawfully perceived as a man and could assume liability or be rebuffed for their activities. In spite of the fact that this viewpoint is still years away, the verbal confrontations around morals are warming up as of now. Thinking about various conceivable outcomes, researchers are attempting to discover a trade off with respect to the bots' rights and obligations.
                    In any case, the likelihood that robots will take every one of the working environments is in reality near zero.
